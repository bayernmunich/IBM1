<h3>Assumptions</h3>            
 This guided activity outlines only the basic set of steps for configuring a cluster and making applications on the cluster highly available.     
 For more information, see the following sources in the information center:

            </ul>
 

<h3>Before you begin</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Determine what cluster topology is appropriate for your environment. A vertical 
    cluster has cluster members on the same node, or physical machine. Use vertical clustering to better scale applications.  A horizontal 
    cluster has cluster members on multiple nodes across many machines in a cell. Horizontal clustering provides the ability to expand the capacity to do work by allowing the addition of hardware to expand the applications.  
    You can configure either type of cluster, or have a combination of vertical 
    and horizontal clusters. See the information center 
    article entitled, 
    <A TARGET="help" HREF="http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/wsbroker/redirect?version=phil&product=was-nd-dist&topic=crun_srvgrp">
    Clusters and workload management</A> 
    for more information.</li>
  <li>In order to populate a cluster with members, the best practice is to fully configure one application server and convert it to be the first member of the cluster. You can then create additional members based on that first member.</li>  
</ul>

       
<h3>When finished</h3>
After you have completed the guided activity, make sure ports that cluster members are listening on are in your virtual host aliases.  If you have a web server associated with the cluster, you must also regenerate the plugin-cfg.xml file.
