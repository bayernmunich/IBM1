<h4>Firewalls</h4>
Make sure that you have the right ports open in any firewalls that reside between the application 
server machines and the machines that are running your Web servers.
The firewall has to have the same administrative port open so that the plug-in file can pass through. 
Check with your network security administrator to verify that the port is opened.

<h4>Polling intervals</h4>
For an HTTP plug-in, the length of the delay that occurs between inquiries for
new versions of the plugin-in configuration file is determined by the Refresh interval attribute of
 the configuration element in the <tt>plugin-cfg.xml</tt> file. The plug-in polls the disk at this interval to 
 determine whether the configuration changed. The default interval is 60 seconds.
