<h4>Generating a plug-in configuration file might take time</h4>
Regenerating the plug-in configuration file for a Web server might take time to complete. 
After regenerating the plug-in configuration file, all of the objects in the administrative cell use their newest settings, which the Web server can access.<p>
The plug-in regeneration process, whether it is triggered manually or occurs automatically, requires about 30 to 60 seconds to complete when the Application Server is on the same physical machine or node as the Web server. In other cases, it takes more time.<p>
The delay is important because it determines how soon the new plug-in configuration takes effect. 
For example, if you add a new served path for a servlet and regenerate the plug-in configuration, the regeneration process requires 40 seconds. After the regeneration process, a user can access the servlet by the new served path.
