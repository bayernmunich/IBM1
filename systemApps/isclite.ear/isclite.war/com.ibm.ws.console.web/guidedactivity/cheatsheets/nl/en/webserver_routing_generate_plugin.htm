      <ul>
          <li>For firewalls, the administrative port firewall must have that same port open to enable the plug-in file to pass.</li>   
	      <li>Plug-in regeneration requires about 60 seconds to complete when the Application Server is on the same physical machine or node as the Web server. In this case, the length of the regeneration process is the same whether the process is triggered manually or occurs automatically. In other cases, the process takes longer. </li>
          <li>By default, the working or active versions of the <tt>plugin-cfg.xml</tt> file reside in the <tt>WAS_HOME/AppServer/config/cells/plugin-cfg.xml</tt> directory. </li>
          <li>Regenerate the plug-in configuration after, for example, installing or removing an enterprise application, adding or removing servlets and mappings from a particular application, or changing the configuration for the plug-in, a virtual host, or a transport. Failure to regenerate the plug-in after introducing a new application might result in a <tt>404 File Not Found</tt> error when you try to access the new Web application. </li>
          <li>Regenerating the plug-in configuration can overwrite manual configuration changes that you might want to preserve. Before performing this task, understand its implications as described in the information center article entitled, <a href="http://wasinfo.raleigh.ibm.com">Configuring a Web server plug-in to communicate with an application server running on a distributed platform.</a></li>
