    <h3>Hints and tips</h3>
<h4>Special considerations with server IDs</h4>
To use Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) as the user registry, you need to know a valid user name (ID),
the user password, the server host and port, the base distinguished name (DN)
and,if necessary, the bind DN and the bind password. You can choose any valid
user in the user registry that is searchable. In some LDAP servers, the administrative
users are not searchable and cannot be used. For example, <TT>cn=root</TT> in
SecureWay is not searchable. This user is referred to as WebSphere Application Server security
server ID, server ID, or server user ID in the documentation. Being a server
ID means a user has special privileges when calling some protected internal
methods. Normally, this ID and password are used to log into the administrative
console after you turn on security. You can use other users to log in if
those users are part of the administrative roles. 
<p>
If security is enabled, this server ID and password are
authenticated with the user registry when the server starts. If authentication
fails, the server does not start. It is important you you choose an ID and password that does not
expire or change often. If the product server user ID or password
need to change in the user registry, make sure that the changes are performed when
all of the product servers are up and running.

<h4>Single signon between Version 6.0.x, 5.0.x, and 4.0.x application servers.</h4>
If you are using single signon between a WebSphere Application Server Version 5.0.x server 
and a WebSphere Application Server Version 4.0.x application server, you must specify an LDAP server port number. 
You must set the LDAP port numbers to the same numerical value because for WebSphere Application Server Versions 6.0.x and 5.0.x 
the default value is 0. For WebSphere Application Server Version 4.0.x, the default value for the port is not 0.
