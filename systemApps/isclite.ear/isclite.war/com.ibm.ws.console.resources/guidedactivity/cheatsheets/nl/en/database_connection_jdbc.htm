    <h3>Hints and tips</h3>
    
    <p>
      A Scope section exists on the JDBC Providers collection page.
      If you are using WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment edition, you see a more advanced set of options displayed in the Scope selection panel.
      Selecting the node scope (that is, Scope: <TT>Cell="MyCell",Node="MyNode"</TT>) means that the JDBC providers that you are configuring are available to all of the application servers that are running on the specified node.
      It is recommended that you use the node scope with WebSphere Application Server-Express and WebSphere Application Server editions. You can collapse the scope section to hide the scope selection fields if you do not plan to do more advanced resource scoping.
      For more information on advanced scope configuration, see the information center article entitled, <A target="help" HREF="http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/wsbroker/redirect?version=phil&product=was-base-dist&topic=rrun_scope">Administrative console scope settings</A>.
    </p> 
    <p>
      If a template is not provided with WebSphere Application Server for your JDBC-compliant database, you can create a user-defined provider during the step where you select a provider type.
      For user-defined JDBC providers, you need to specify the correct implementation class name on the Details panel. Consult your client
      driver documentation for your database vendor to determine the proper implementation class and Java archive (JAR) names to use. 
      The default values for the implementation class and class paths for user-defined providers in the administrative console do not work without modification and are only provided as hints.
