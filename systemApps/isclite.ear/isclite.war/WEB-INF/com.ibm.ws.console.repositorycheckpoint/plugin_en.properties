repository.description=The extended repository service enables advanced management of the configuration repository.  The configuration repository contains the configuration for the cell.  This information is essential to the operation of your applications.  You can create repository checkpoints to help you save snapshots of your configuration as you make changes, so that you can easily undo those changes if necessary.  You can configure your repository to create automatic delta checkpoints each time you make a configuration change.  A delta checkpoint saves a copy of the configuration documents prior to saving your changes.  You can specify the number of automatic checkpoints to save.  Once this limit is reached, the next checkpoint replaces the oldest.

repositorycheckpoint.description=Repository checkpoints represent saved images of the repository before configuration changes are made.  Checkpoints can be either full or delta images.  A full checkpoint is created manually by the adminstrator and is a copy of the entire configuration repository.  This includes applications and connnectors, so it can be very large.  A delta checkpoint is created automatically when configuration changes are made.  The delta checkpoint is formed by making a copy of the configuration documents affected by the configuration change before the changes are actually applied.  Checkpoints can be used to restore the configuration repository back to a prior state.  Use a full checkpoint to restore the entire configuration repository back to the state it was in at the time the full checkpoint was made.  Use delta checkpoints to undo recent changes.  Delta checkpoints can only be restored in the reverse order in which they were created.  Each delta checkpoint has a sequence number.  The highest sequence number represents the most recent delta checkpoint.  Delta checkpoints can be restored in descending sequence number only.  After the configuration repository is restored from a delta checkpoint, the product creates a checkpoint that contains the configuration before restoration.
