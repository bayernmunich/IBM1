controller.displayname=Global Health Controller Parameters
controller.description=These parameters are used to configure the global Health Controller parameters. These parameters are used by the Health Controller in cooperation with the defined Health Policies.
controller.ccl=Control cycle length
controller.mcr=Maximum consecutive restarts
controller.mri=Minimum restart interval
controller.rt=Restart timeout
controller.enabled=Enable health monitoring
controller.ccl.description=This field specifies the length of time between checking an application server instance to determine if a health policy condition has been breached.
controller.mcr.description=This field specifies the number of attempts to revive an application server once a restart is performed.  If the maximum number of attempts is exceeded, the instance restart is declared to be failed.
controller.mri.description=This field controls the minimum amount of time that must pass between restarts of an application server instance.
controller.rt.description=This field specifies how long to wait before declaring a restart a failure.
controller.enabled.description=This field toggles the Health Monitoring between on and off.  When monitoring is toggled off, the health conditions defined in health policies are not be monitored.
controller.timeConstraints=Prohibited restart times
controller.timeConstraints.desc=This field controls the restart by specifying the times that prohibit a restart.

HMM_ERROR_VALUE_RESTART_TIMEOUT_OUT_OF_RANGE=The value for the Restart time out is out of range.  It must be a whole number between 1 and 60.
HMM_ERROR_VALUE_MAX_RESTARTS_OUT_OF_RANGE=The value for the Maximum number of consecutive restarts is out of range.  It must be a whole number between 1 and 5.
HMM_ERROR_VALUE_MIN_RESTART_INTERVAL_OUT_OF_RANGE=The value for the Minimum restart interval is out of range.  It must be between 15 minutes and 365 days.  A zero value is allowed meaning "unset".
