SchedulerConfiguration.workmanager.JNDI.name.set.to.missing.value=The work manager JNDI name is currently configured to "{0}", but this is an invalid value for this scheduler because the JNDI name either doesn't exist or isn't visible to this scheduler in the scope hierarchy. This will cause your scheduler to fail. The value has been removed from the dropdown list, and it's recommended you either select a different value or create a work manager with the specified JNDI name that's visible to this scheduler.

ObjectPool.description=Specifies that you register custom object pool interfaces and implementation classes. With this registration, you can set custom properties when you create pooled objects.
ObjectPool.poolClassName.description=Specifies the fully-qualified class name of the objects that are stored in the custom object pool.
ObjectPool.poolImplClassName.description=Specifies the fully-qualified class name of the implementation class for the custom object pool.
ObjectPoolManagerInfo.description=Specifies an object pool manager that manages custom object pools that application servers use.
ObjectPoolManagerInfo.objectPools.description=Specifies custom object pools for object pool managers. Custom object pools are optional.
SchedulerConfiguration.datasourceAlias.description=Specifies the alias for the user name and password that are used to access the data source.
SchedulerConfiguration.datasourceJNDIName.description=Specifies the name of the data source where persistent tasks are stored.
SchedulerConfiguration.description=Specifies scheduler resources that the server uses. Schedulers are persistent and transactional timer services that can run business logic. Each scheduler runs tasks independently and has a programming interface accessible from Java(TM) Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) applications using the Java(TM) Naming and  Directory Interface (JNDI). You can also manage schedulers using a Java(TM) Management Extensions (JMX) MBean. See the scheduler documentation in the information center for details on how to configure and use schedulers.
SchedulerConfiguration.pollInterval.description=Specifies the interval, in seconds, that a scheduler polls the database. The default value is appropriate for most applications.
SchedulerConfiguration.tablePrefix.description=Specifies the string prefix to affix to the scheduler tables. Multiple independent schedulers can share the same database if each scheduler specifies a different prefix string.
SchedulerConfiguration.useAdminRoles.description=Specifies that when this option and global security are both enabled, the user administration roles are enforced when the scheduler  Java(TM) Management Extensions (JMX) commands or APIs are used to create and modify tasks. If this option is not enabled, all users can create and modify tasks.
SchedulerConfiguration.workmanagerJNDIName.description=Specifies the Java(TM) Naming and  Directory Interface (JNDI) name of the work manager, which is used to manage the number of tasks that can run concurrently with the scheduler. The work manager can also limit the amount of Java(TM) Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) context that is applied to the task.
TimerManagerInfo.description=Specifies that a timer manager enables applications to schedule future timer notifications and receive timer notification callbacks to application-specified listeners within a Java(TM) Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) environment. The timer manager binds to the Java(TM) Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) name space.
TimerManagerInfo.numAlarmThreads.description=Specifies the maximum number of threads that are used for timers.
TimerManagerInfo.serviceNames.description=Specifies a list of services to make available to this timer manager.
WorkManager.service.appprofile.Description=Specifies that when this option is selected, the application profile service is enabled, and when the application profile service property 5.x compatibility mode is selected, the application profile task that is associated with the scheduling thread is available on the target thread for J2EE 1.3 applications. For J2EE 1.4 applications, the application profile task is a property of its associated unit of work, rather than a thread. This option has no effect on the behavior of the task in J2EE 1.4 applications. The scheduled work that runs in a J2EE 1.4 application does not get the application profiling task of the scheduling thread.
WorkManager.service.i18n.Description=Specifies that when this option is selected and the internationalization service is enabled, the internationalization context that exists on the scheduling thread is available on the target thread.
WorkManager.service.security.Description=Specifies that when this option is selected, the Java(TM) Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) subject that exists on the scheduling thread is available on the target thread. If not selected, the thread runs anonymously.
WorkManager.service.wlm.Description=Specifies that when this option is selected, the target thread inherits the WebSphere(R) Application Server for z/OS(R) product transaction workload classification of the scheduling thread. If not selected, the default transaction class or the daemon transaction class settings are used to reclassify the target thread. (This setting applies only to the z/OS(R) product.)
WorkManager.service.workarea.Description=Specifies that when this option is selected, the work area context for every work area partition that exists on the scheduling thread is available on the target thread.
WorkManagerInfo.daemonTransactionClass.description=Specifies the transaction class that is used for the Work Load Manager Service workload classification of daemon work.
WorkManagerInfo.defaultTransactionClass.description=Specifies the transaction class that is used for the Work Load Manager Service workload classification of non-daemon work that is not already associated with a service class.
WorkManagerInfo.description=Specifies a work manager that contains a pool of threads that are bound into the Java(TM) Naming and  Directory Interface (JNDI).
WorkManagerInfo.isDistributable.description=Specifies whether the scheduled work object started with this work manager is distributed to other cluster members.
WorkManagerInfo.isGrowable.description=Specifies whether the number of threads in this work manager can be increased.
WorkManagerInfo.maxThreads.description=Specifies the maximum number of threads that are available in this work manager.
WorkManagerInfo.minThreads.description=Specifies the minimum number of threads that are available in this work manager.
WorkManagerInfo.numAlarmThreads.description=Specifies the desired maximum number of threads that are used for alarms. The default value is 2.
WorkManagerInfo.serviceNames.description=Specifies a list of services to make available to this work manager.
WorkManagerInfo.threadPriority.description=Specifies the priority of the threads that are available in this work manager.
WorkManagerInfo.workRequestQueueFullAction.description=Specifies the action that is taken when the thread pool is exhausted, and the work request queue is full. This action starts when you submit non-daemon work to the work manager. The default value is block.
WorkManagerInfo.workRequestQueueSize.description=Specifies the size of the work request queue. The work request queue is a buffer that holds scheduled work objects and may be a value of 1 or greater. The thread pool pulls work from this queue. If you do not specify a value or the value is 0, the queue size is managed automatically. Large values can consume significant system resources.
WorkManagerInfo.workTimeout.description=Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait before a scheduled work object is released. If not specified, the timeout is disabled.
