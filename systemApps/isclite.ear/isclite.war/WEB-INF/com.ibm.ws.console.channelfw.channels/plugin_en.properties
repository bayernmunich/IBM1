HTTPInboundChannel.frcaLogging.globalService.description=Specifies whether global FRCA logging is occurring.
HTTPInboundChannel.keepAlive.description=Specifies whether persistent connections, also referred to as keep alive connections, rather than connections that close after the request and response exchange, are allowed when sending an outgoing HTTP message.
HTTPInboundChannel.logging.description=
HTTPInboundChannel.maximumPersistentRequests.description=Specifies the maximum requests that are allowed on a single HTTP connection. 0 or 1 indicates one single request per connection.
HTTPInboundChannel.maximumPersistentRequests.limited.description=Specifies the maximum number of requests that are allowed on a single HTTP connection.
HTTPInboundChannel.maximumPersistentRequests.unlimited.description=Specifies that unlimited requests are allowed per connection.
HTTPInboundChannel.persistentConnections.group.displayName.description=Specifies whether persistent connections are used.

HTTPInboundChannel.writeTimeout.description=Specifies the maximum amount of time, in seconds, that the server waits for a write operation on a socket to complete.
HTTPQueueInboundChannel.description=Use this page to view and configure a HTTP queue inbound channel.  This channel enables the AsyncRequestDispatcher feature.
HTTPTunnelInboundChannel.description=Use this page to view and configure HTTP tunnel transport channels. Inbound connections that are sent through this channel are tunneled over HTTP. The tunneling allows intermediate recipients of the data to view this data as the body of an HTTP message instead of in its natural format. This type of channel is typically used to circumvent protocol-aware firewalls.
ORBInboundChannel.description=Use this page to view and configure an object request broker (ORB) service transport channel. This type of transport channel handles CORBA and RMI/IIOP inbound messages for the ORB Service. The ORB service transport channel enables clients to make requests and receive responses from servers in a network-distributed environment.
ProxyInboundChannel.description=Use this page to view and configure a transport channel that provides HTTP proxy capabilities.
SIPContainerInboundChannel.description=Use this page to view and configure a transport channel for a session initiation protocol (SIP) container.

TCPInboundChannel.threadPool.description=Specifies the thread pool to use for handling traffic on this channel.
UDPInboundChannel.addressExcludeList.description=Specifies the IP addresses that are not allowed to make inbound connections.

All four numeric values in an IPv4 address must be represented by a number, or an asterisk, which is the wildcard character.
UDPInboundChannel.addressIncludeList.description=Specifies the IP addresses that are allowed to make inbound connections. Use a comma to separate the IPv4 or IPv6 addresses to which you want to allow access on inbound UDP connection requests.
