WRSM.InboundSequence.description=This page displays the collection of inbound sequences for the current scope. Each inbound sequence is used to receive messages that have been transmitted reliably.
WSRM.AckState.description=The ranges of message sequence numbers received from the WS-ReliableMessaging source. If more than one range is displayed, this indicates a gap in the messages received. If "In-order delivery" is selected for the sequence manager, messages with a sequence number greater than the lowest gap cannot be delivered to the application until the gap is closed.
WSRM.InboundMessage.description=The messages on the inbound sequence.
WSRM.MessageNumber.description=The index number of the message in the sequence.
WSRM.MessageStore.description=This page displays the collection of reliable messaging storage managers for the current scope.
WSRM.OutboundMessage.description=The messages on the outbound sequence.
WSRM.acksToEPR.description=The address used for WS-ReliableMessaging acknowledgements.
WSRM.exportMessages.description=Export the messages from the selected sequences to ZIP files.
WSRM.exportMessagesZIPsTable.description=A list of the exported messages ZIP files that have been created. To save these ZIP files to your file system, click each file individually then use your web browser "save file" option.
WSRM.fromEndpoint.description=The WS-Addressing "from" address that is used for the inbound create sequence message.
WSRM.highEndOfRange.description=The message number for the highest numbered message in this range.
WSRM.highestInMsgNumber.description=The highest message number that has been received within the sequence.
WSRM.isInOrder.description=When this parameter is true, messages are dispatched to the application in the order that they were assigned to the sequence.
WSRM.lastActivatedTime.description=The time at which this sequence last received a message.
WSRM.lowEndOfRange.description=The message number for the lowest numbered message in this range.
WSRM.message.contents.description=The contents of the message.
WSRM.message.description=The details of an individual message.
WSRM.message.seqNum.description=The index number of the message in the sequence.
WSRM.messageState.description=The only possible state is "Awaiting dispatch to application".
WSRM.messageStore.description=The quality of service being used and the application name.
WSRM.messageStore.details.description=For in-memory stores the only possible value is  "Running". For messages stored by a messaging engine, the possible values are "Running" or  "Messaging engine not contactable", probably because the messaging engine is not running.
WSRM.messageStore.status.description=The "OK" icon indicates that the message store is running. If the messaging engine is not contactable, the "Error" icon is displayed.
WSRM.messageStoreType.description=For the managed qualities of service, the messages are written to a messaging engine. For the unmanaged non-persistent quality of service, the messages are stored in memory.
WSRM.messageStores.description=The reliable messaging storage managers for the current scope.
WSRM.messagesReceived.description=The total count of application messages received for the sequence since its creation.
WSRM.messagesSent.description=The total count of application messages assigned to the sequence since its creation.
WSRM.outMessageState.description=The two possible states are "Sendable" (indicating that it is expected to be sent soon) and "Awaiting sequence initialization".
WSRM.replyToEndpoint.description=The WS-Addressing replyTo address that is used for WS-ReliableMessaging protocol messages.
WSRM.wsaNamespace.description=The WS-Addressing namespace that is associated with the sequence.
WSRM.wsrmNamespace.description=The namespace that is defined by the version of the WS-ReliableMessaging specification used by the sequence.
WSRMInboundSequence.associatedApp.description=The application that is receiving messages from the sequence.
WSRMInboundSequence.details.description=The current state of the sequence. "Connected" indicates that the sequence has been established; "Awaiting redelivery of a missing msg." indicates that there is a gap in the sequence; "Closed" indicates that the sequence has been closed; "Failed due to missing message" indicates that the sequence terminated with a gap in the sequence.
WSRMInboundSequence.messageDepth.description=The count of messages, held by the reliable messaging layer, that have not yet been dispatched to the application.
WSRMOutboundSequence.associatedApp.description=The application that created the sequence.
WSRMOutboundSequence.description=This page displays the collection of outbound sequences for the current scope. Outbound sequences are used to transmit messages reliably from the local application to the remote endpoint. Each sequence has a unique identifier.
WSRMOutboundSequence.details.description=The current state of the sequence. "Establishing" indicates that the sequence is awaiting a CreateSequenceResponse message from the reliable messaging  destination; "Active" indicates that the sequence has been established; "Cannot contact the remote endpoint" indicates that the sequence has been established but the reliable messaging  destination has stopped acknowledging messages; "Sequence closing" indicates that the sequence is closing and will accept no new messages; "Sequence closed" indicates that the sequence has been closed and will accept no new messages; "Sequence terminating" indicates that the sequence is terminating and will accept no new messages; "The inbound side has lost state in a terminate" indicates that the sequence has terminated with unacknowledged  messages outstanding; "The sequence has timed out" indicates that the sequence has timed out.
WSRMOutboundSequence.internalSequenceId.description=The identifier that is used within the application server runtime environment.
WSRMOutboundSequence.messagesSent.description=The total count of messages sent by the application for this sequence.
WSRMOutboundSequence.queueDepth.description=The count of messages, held by the reliable messaging layer, that have not yet been transferred.
WSRMOutboundSequence.sequenceId.description=This URI is the unique identifier for the sequence.
WSRMOutboundSequence.status.description=The icon indicates "OK", "Warning" or "Error" as previously described on this page. A more precise indication of the sequence state is given in the "Details" column.
WSRMOutboundSequence.targetEndpoint.description=The destination to which messages are transmitted.
WSRMState.description=This page provides an overview of the WS-ReliableMessaging runtime state. Use this page to manage reliable messaging at run time.
