AutonomicRequestFlowManager.request.rejection.policy.desc=A rejection policy prevents a CPU from being overloaded by rejecting incoming HTTP or SIP messages that are not part of pre-existing dialogs or sessions for HTTP or SIP traffic.
AutonomicRequestFlowManager.request.rejection.threshold=Rejection threshold:
AutonomicRequestFlowManager.request.rejection.threshold.desc=The product of the rejection threshold and the service policy average response time helps predict the allowable response time.
