ActivitySessionService.defaultTimeout.description=Specifies the default timeout for an activity session. A server automatically completes an activity session if a remote client has failed to complete the activity session within this time period.
ActivitySessionService.description=Use this page to configure the properties of the ActivitySession service. The ActivitySession service is a unit-of-work service to coordinate one-phase resources or to extend the activation and passivation of an enterprise bean.
ApplicationProfileService.compatibility.description=Specifies that J2EE 1.3 applications that use application profiling run exactly as they did in Version 5 and later releases, when set to True. Operation in this mode might cause unexpected deadlocks during database access. Also, tasks do not propagate on remote invocations between J2EE 1.3 and J2EE 1.4 applications. This behavior might result in using unexpected access intent policies and performance degradation, if the applications that are configured with application profiling are installed on the server. When set to False, J2EE 1.3 applications that use application profiling run with the same constraints as J2EE 1.4 applications. In this mode, tasks are established only when a new unit of work begins. The complete unit of work runs under no more than one task. Support for J2EE 1.3 applications that operate with Version 5.x compatibility mode set to True is deprecated as of the Version 6 release. The default value is True.
ApplicationProfileService.description=Specifies the application profiling service that controls the scope and propagation of task names. This value also manages the association of tasks, application profiles, and the policies that are configured within application profiles.
CompensationService.compensationHandlerRetryInterval.description=Specifies the time interval, in seconds, that the compensation service waits before retrying a compensation handler.
CompensationService.compensationHandlerRetryLimit.description=Specifies the maximum number of times that the compensation service retries a compensation handler.
CompensationService.description=Use this page to manage the compensation service. The compensation service supports server-level configuration for compensation enablement and logging.
CompensationService.recoveryLogDirectory.description=Specifies a directory path that, if set, overrides the location where the compensation service stores log files for recovery of this server.
CompensationService.recoveryLogFileSize.description=Specifies the maximum megabyte (MB) size of the recovery log file that the compensation service uses for recovery data. The default value is 5 megabytes. 
I18NService.description=An internationalized application can be configured to interact with users from different regions in culturally appropriate ways. The internationalization service enables you to configure and manage an internationalization context for an application for which components are distributed across the enterprise.
ObjectPoolService.description=Many Java objects can be created once, used, and then reused. The object pool service manages object pool resources that are used by the application server.
SchedulerService.description=Schedulers enable Java(TM) Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) application tasks to run at a requested time.
StartupBeansService.description=Startup beans are session beans that run business logic through the invocation of start and stop methods when applications start and stop. If the startup beans service is disabled, the automatic invocation of the start and stop methods does not occur for deployed startup beans when the parent application starts or stops. This service is disabled by default. Enable this service only when you want to use startup beans.
WorkAreaPartition.bidirectional.description=Specifies that, when enabled, the bidirectional attribute permits applications to modify a work area context imported by a Java(TM) Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) request. The modified properties are propagated back to the requestor environment. This option is disabled by default.
WorkAreaPartition.deferredAttributeSerialization.description=Specifies that, by default, the work area service serializes attributes when they are set into a work area and deserializes the attributes when they are retrieved from a work area. Enabling this option defers attribute serialization until the work area is propagated on a remote invocation. The work area service caches both the serialized and the deserialized form of each attribute for optimal performance. This option is disabled by default.
WorkAreaPartition.description=Use this page to configure a work area partition and isolated work area functionality.
WorkAreaPartition.description.description=Specifies the description of the given partition.
WorkAreaPartition.enable.description=Specifies whether the server attempts to start the specified partition when the server starts.
WorkAreaPartition.enableWebServicePropagation.description=Specifies whether the work area is propagated on web service requests.
WorkAreaPartition.name.description=Specifies the name of the work area partition to be created. The name must be unique, as it helps to retrieve the partition.
WorkAreaPartition.properties.description=Specifies additional custom properties for this partition that are configurable.
WorkAreaPartitionService.description=Specifies that the work area partition service supports the definition of custom work area partitions.
WorkAreaService.description=Use this page to manage the work area service.  The work area service manages the scope and implicit propagation of the application context.
WorkAreaService.maxReceiveSize.description=Specifies the maximum size of data that can be received within a single work area. 
WorkAreaService.maxSendSize.description=Specifies the maximum size of data that can be sent within a single work area. 
WorkManagerService.description=Specifies the work manager service that manages work manager resources used by a given server.
