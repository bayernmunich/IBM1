<BODY>
<p>WebSphere Extended Deployment introduces a new server type called an On Demand Router (ODR). The ODR is a special server that acts as a proxy, or 
intermediary for HTTP requests and the application servers committed to complete those requests. This is not a new concept, as most WebSphere 
users are used to proxy servers and their function. However, the ODR has some special abilities that are unique.
<p>
The ODR contains a component called an On Demand Configuration (ODC). The
ODC automatically tries to get information about all the WebSphere Extended Deployment application
servers and applications deployed in the cell. The ODC will dynamically
configure the routing rules at runtime to allow the ODR to accurately route
HTTP requests to those application servers. 
<p>
Upon creation, an ODR will effectively be able to route HTTP requests to
WebSphere Extended Deployment nodes.
<p>
The ODR has the additional ability to route work to non-WebSphere Extended Deployment nodes.
This function allows an enterprise to take advantage of the unique routing
abilities the ODR has on non-WebSphere nodes. The ODR routes work to non-XD
servers in the same manner, but with some different configurations. The
dynamic ability of the ODR does not fully extend outside of the XD environment,
so the ODC is not functional. However, the advanced configuration options
extend the ability of the ODR.
<p>
When routing work beyond WebSphere Extended Deployment nodes, you must configure your ODR with Generic Server Clusters, URI Groups, and Routing Rules.
<UL>
  <LI>Generic server clusters is a user defined logical cluster of non-WebSphere
  Extended Deployment servers that the ODR can route to. 
  <LI>URI groups are common application URIs that best define the content being
  served by the cluster. 
  <LI>Routing rules use specific matching criteria that the ODR uses as comparison
  criteria when routing requests.
</UL>
<p>Generic server clusters define the boundaries, or endpoints of the cluster,
but the ODR applies routing rules to the incoming requests, which in turn
pull URI groups into the cluster. In effect the routing rules become the
bond that relate generic server clusters to URI groups.
<p>
In a homogenous WebSphere Extended Deployment environment, the ODC function of the ODR is
automated and dynamically creates and updates the routing table. In a mixed
environment, generic server clusters, URI groups, and routing rules are
used to create static routes without the dynamic application routing and
server sensing capabilities of the ODC.
