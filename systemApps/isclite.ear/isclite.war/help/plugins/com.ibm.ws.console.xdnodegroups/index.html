            <li>
               <a href="uwve_elasticity_addremove.html">Add and remove setting</a>
               <br/>Use this page to define actions for the add and remove
elasticity operation. Ensure that elasticity custom actions are created
before you define actions for add and remove elasticity operations. </li>
            <li>
               <a href="placement_custom.html">Application placement controller custom properties</a>
               <br/>Use this page to view and manage a list of arbitrary name-value
pairs of data, where the name is a property key and the value is a
string value that can be used to set internal system configuration
properties. Defining a new property enables you to configure a setting
beyond that which is available in the administrative console.</li>
            <li>
               <a href="apc.html">Application placement controller settings</a>
               <br/>Use this page to define the settings that control application
placement. You can enable the autonomic placement controller, define
how often placement changes occur, and control the behavior of the
placement controller when it is operating in supervised mode.</li>
            <li>
               <a href="arfm.html">Autonomic request flow manager settings</a>
               <br/>Use this panel to configure the autonomic request flow
manager (ARFM). The ARFM manages incoming messages for applications
by determining whether and when to allow the messages to be serviced
by middleware servers.  These management actions take place in the
on demand routers for HTTP and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) traffic,
and in the application servers for Java Message
Service (JMS) and Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (IIOP) messages.</li>
            <li>
               <a href="uwve_elasticity_custact.html">Elasticity custom actions collection</a>
               <br/>Use this page to manage user-defined actions that can be
performed with elasticity operations. Elasticity operations enable
you to dynamically add or remove nodes in the cell to grow or shrink
system resources.</li>
            <li>
               <a href="uwve_elasticity_custact_nonjava_detail.html">Elasticity custom actions settings, not using Java</a>
               <br/>Use this page to modify user-defined actions that do not
use Java, and that can be performed
with elasticity operations. Elasticity operations enable you to dynamically
add or remove nodes in the cell to grow or shrink system resources.</li>

               <a href="uwve_elasticity_custact_java_detail.html">Elasticity custom actions settings, using Java</a>
               <br/>Use this page to modify user-defined Java actions that can be performed with elasticity
operations. Elasticity operations enable you to dynamically add or
