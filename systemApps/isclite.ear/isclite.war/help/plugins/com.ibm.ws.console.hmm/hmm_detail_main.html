<h1 class="title topictitle1">Global health controller parameters</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Use this page to modify the global health controller settings,
which are global parameters that are created by default. The health
controller acts upon health policies to ensure that certain conditions
in the environment are met. A health policy is a specific health criteria
that you set. You can also apply limits to the frequency of restarts
or prohibit restarts during certain times.</p>
<p class="p">To view this administrative console page, click <span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Operational policies</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol"> Autonomic managers</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol"> Health controller</span></span>.</p>
<p class="p">The <span class="ph">Intelligent Management</span> provides
a continuous health monitoring and management subsystem to detect
functional degradation related to software malfunctions.</p>
<p class="p">This page is divided into two tabs: <span class="ph uicontrol">Configuration</span> and <span class="ph uicontrol">Runtime</span>.
With the Configuration tab, you can view previously configured fields,
and in some cases, edit the fields. With the Runtime tab, you can
view the fields that are currently used by the health controller,
and in some cases, make changes to the values. Unlike the Configuration
tab, when you change values on the Runtime tab, the changes go directly
to the health controller to change the parameters that the controller
uses at that time. The changes are not stored into the repository
by default, so you can make a temporary change to the parameters that
does not persist.</p>
<p class="p">Depending on your administrative role, you are allowed specific
privileges when configuring the health controller.  This list shows
the administrative roles and privileges for configuring the health
controller:</p>
<dl class="dl"><dt class="dt dlterm">Monitor</dt>
<dd class="dd">Can view the information.</dd>
<dt class="dt dlterm">Operator</dt>
<dd class="dd">Can view the information on the configuration tab. Can change
the settings on the runtime tab.</dd>
<dt class="dt dlterm">Configurator</dt>
<dd class="dd">Can change the configuration but not the runtime settings.</dd>
<dt class="dt dlterm">Administrator</dt>
<dd class="dd">Has all privileges.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="topic nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="health_ctl_enable"><h2 class="title topictitle2">Enable health monitoring</h2>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Specifies if health monitoring is enabled.</p>
<p class="p">When enabled, the health controller continuously monitors the health
policies in the system. When disabled, health conditions that are
defined in the health policies are not monitored. You can disable
the health controller without removing the health policies from the
system.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="topic nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="health_ctl_cycle_length"><h2 class="title topictitle2">Control cycle length</h2>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Specifies the time between consecutive health checks to
determine if a health policy condition is breached. The value is specified
in minutes and ranges from <samp class="ph codeph">1</samp> to <samp class="ph codeph">60</samp> minutes.
Longer control cycles reduce the health monitoring load.</p>
<p class="p">The disadvantage is that health conditions that occur during the
period are not detected until the next control cycle. For example,
if you have a health policy with a workload condition of 10,000 requests
associated with an application server, and the control cycle length
value is specified as <samp class="ph codeph">60</samp> minutes, the controller
checks only every 60 minutes to determine if the application server
has serviced 10,000 requests. If the application server served 9,999
requests at the time of check up, the controller does not check again
for another 60 minutes. Therefore, the server might serve more than
10,000 requests before restarting the server.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="topic nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="health_ctl_max_consec_restarts"><h2 class="title topictitle2">Maximum consecutive restarts</h2>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Specifies the number of attempts to revive an application
server after a restart decision is made. </p>
<p class="p">If this number is exceeded, a failed operation is assumed and restarts
are disabled for the server. The value must be a whole number between <samp class="ph codeph">1</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">5</samp>,
inclusive.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="topic nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="health_ctl_restart_timeout"><h2 class="title topictitle2">Restart timeout</h2>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Specifies how long to wait for a server to stop before
explicitly checking its state and attempting another start.</p>
<p class="p">A restart consists of the sequence of stop and start server actions.
If in your environment, the action of starting or stopping an application
server is unusually high, you might want to set this value so that
the restart action does not time out. The value is always specified
in minutes and can range from <samp class="ph codeph">1</samp> minute to <samp class="ph codeph">60</samp> minutes,
specified as a whole number.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="topic nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="health_ctl_min_restart_interval"><h2 class="title topictitle2">Minimum restart interval</h2>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Controls the minimum amount of time that must pass between
consecutive restarts of an application server instance.</p>
<p class="p">If a health condition for an application server is breached during
this time, the restart is set to a pending state. The restart occurs
when the minimum restart interval passes. The value can range from <samp class="ph codeph">15
minutes</samp> to <samp class="ph codeph">365 days</samp>, inclusive. A value
of <samp class="ph codeph">0</samp> disables the minimum restart value.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="topic nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="health_ctl_prohibit_restart_times"><h2 class="title topictitle2">Prohibited restart times</h2>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Specifies the times and days of the week during which a
restart of an application server instance is prohibited. </p>
<p class="p">The start and end times are specified by selecting the hour and
minute using a 24-hour clock, and the days of the week. You can specify
multiple time blocks if needed. If you specify a start time and end
time, you must also specify at least one day of the week that these
times are prohibited. The block between the start time and end time
cannot cross the boundary of midnight. For example, if you need to
specify a block of 10:00 PM to 1:00 AM, specify two blocks, one from <samp class="ph codeph">22:00</samp> to <samp class="ph codeph">23:59</samp> and
one from <samp class="ph codeph">00:00</samp> to <samp class="ph codeph">01:00</samp>. Click <span class="ph uicontrol">Add</span> to
add additional time constraints. To remove an existing constraint,
highlight the constraint and click <span class="ph uicontrol">Remove</span>.
Any actions on violated health conditions do not occur until after
the prohibited time interval passes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="topic nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="health_ctl_save_to_config"><h2 class="title topictitle2">Save to configuration</h2>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Saves the runtime values to the configuration.</p>
<p class="p">You can make changes and view how the system reacts with the updated
values. To permanently save the values, select this option instead
of returning to the <span class="ph uicontrol">Configuration</span> tab to enter
all of the same values.</p>
