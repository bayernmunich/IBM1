// Administrative console help mapping file for HTTP access logging
//
// Created 10/3/2005
// V6.0 Help information
//
// The HelpCoord reads this file to correlate a helpId to a help file
// <helpID>$<help file name with path>
//
// This is not quite like the mapping files for AAT and other Java GUIs.
// You do NOT need the path information in front of the help file names.
// The delimiter is dollar sign instead of pound sign.
// Do not confuse the two file formats.
//
// This is a really persnickety file!
//
// Every line of this file must either be valid input,
// or a comment line beginning with two forward slashes.
//
// There can be NO blank lines.
//
// The last non-blank line in the file cannot have a return
// at the end of it. To test, place cursor at end of last
// non-blank line and press down arrow on keyboard. The
// cursor should not move.
//
// Violations can cause the GUI not to start!
//
// This file does not require translation.
