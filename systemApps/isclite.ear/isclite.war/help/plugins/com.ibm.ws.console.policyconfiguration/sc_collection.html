be unique among service policies and cannot begin with a . or a space.
A space does not generate an error, but leading and trailing spaces
are automatically deleted. Create meaningful service policy names
that are used consistently. For example, PLATINUM, GOLD, SILVER, and
BRONZE are good service policy names.</p>

By defining goal properties, you can determine when and for how long a service policy runs. A service policy is a user-defined business goal, and correlates to transaction and work class components. A service policy categorizes and prioritizes work requests. The service policy creates the goal, while the work classes connect specified information such as Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to that goal. Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (IIOP) type work classes use Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) and EJB method names to map to the goal.
