By defining goal properties, you can determine when and for how long a service policy runs. A service policy is a user-defined business goal, and correlates to transaction and work class components. A service policy categorizes and prioritizes work requests. The service policy creates the goal, while the work classes connect specified information such as Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to that goal. Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (IIOP) type work classes use Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) and EJB method names to map to the goal. Java Message Service (JMS) type work classes use bus and destination names to map to the goal.">Define service policy goal properties</a></div>
