page. By defining goal properties, you can determine when and for
how long a service policy runs. A service policy is a user-defined
business goal, and correlates to transaction and work class components.
A service policy categorizes and prioritizes work requests. The service
policy creates the goal, while the work classes connect specified
information such as Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to that goal.
Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (IIOP) type work classes use Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) and EJB method
names to map to the goal. Java Message
Service (JMS) type work classes use bus and destination names to map
to the goal. </p>
