<h1 class="title topictitle1">Service policy overview</h1>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">You can create service policies that fit user-defined business
goals. Service policies create work-related goals used to categorize
and prioritize work.</p>
<p class="p">To view this administrative console page, click <span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Operational policies</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol">Service policies</span></span>.</p>
<p class="p">To create, modify, or remove service policies
and transaction classes, you must have administrator or configurator
administrative privileges.</p>
<div class="p">The service policies are used to:<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Categorize work.</li>
<li class="li">Associate a performance goal to that class of work.</li>
<li class="li">Define the relative importance of achieving a performance goal
for that class of work.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p"> To categorize work, the concept of a transaction class is used.
Transaction classes are components of a service policy. A transaction
class contains user-defined Universal Resource Identifiers (URI).
For example, all <samp class="ph tt"><span class="ph filepath">/buy/*.html</span> </samp> URI strings
can be associated with the transaction class <span class="ph uicontrol">PayTransactionsClass</span>.
Transaction classes are the smallest unit of categorization in the
intelligent management environment. Data collected at this level can
display performance metrics at the granularity of a single transaction
class. </p>
<p class="p">The product can associate performance goals to transaction class
level work using a service policy. A service policy is defined as
a collection of transaction classes with an associated performance
goal. For example, you can create a service policy called <span class="ph uicontrol">Platinum</span> and
associate <span class="ph uicontrol">PayTransactionClass</span> as a member.
Define performance goals associated with transaction classes in terms
of response times. The product supports average response time goals,
as well as percentile response time goals. </p>
<p class="p">When defining a service policy, seven different levels of importance
can be used. If the performance goals for all service policies are
not met due to prolonged intense overload, the importance criteria
are used to decide which service policy takes priority.</p>

By defining goal properties, you can determine when and for how long a service policy runs. A service policy is a user-defined business goal, and correlates to transaction and work class components. A service policy categorizes and prioritizes work requests. The service policy creates the goal, while the work classes connect specified information such as Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to that goal. Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (IIOP) type work classes use Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) and EJB method names to map to the goal.
