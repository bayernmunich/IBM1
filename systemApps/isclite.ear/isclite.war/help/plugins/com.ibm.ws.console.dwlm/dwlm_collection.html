<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Dynamic workload manager (DWLM) applies the same principles
as the workload manager (WLM). Both DWLM and WLM perform routing based
on a weight system, which establishes a prioritized routing system.
Instead of manually setting a static weight like WLM, DWLM grants
the system the ability to modify the weights to stay current with
business goals. </p>

<p class="p">Selecting the check box grants the system the ability to modify
the WLM weights, if necessary. Not selecting the check box disables
the DWLM functionality.</p>
<div class="p">Consider the following items when deciding whether to enable DWLM:<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Does your cluster need a static weight or do you want cluster
weight to change with the traffic capacity?<p class="p">If you are using dynamic
operations for the cluster, then you set business goals and use policies
to define your threshold. In this case, setting a static weight is
not useful. If you are working in a static environment, then set a
static weight.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Are you planning on using dynamic operations? <p class="p">If you intend
to use the automatic mode for dynamic operations, then setting a static
WLM weight on any of your dynamic clusters could get in the way of
allowing dynamic operations to function properly.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Do you want to restrict certain work from being done on the cluster? <p class="p">If
you have a cluster that you do not want to be dedicated to the current
workload, then you can create it as a static cluster and define a
static WLM weight to it. By setting a static weight, you are setting
aside a percentage of the cluster for other work.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Are you interested in using HTTP session rebalancing?<p class="p">With HTTP
session rebalancing, the product can dynamically and actively balance
the distribution of HTTP sessions among application servers.</p>
