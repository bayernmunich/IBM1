</div>
<div class="topic nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="healthcondition"><h2 class="title topictitle2">Health condition</h2>
<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The health condition defines the specific policy that is
implemented.</p>
<p class="p" id="healthcondition__hp_desc">Some policies are prevention-based and some are detection-based.
Prevention-based policies are used to avoid conditions that might
lead to problems, while the detection-based policies are used to identify
existing conditions and to achieve resolution. These policies can
be used to perform health-based assessments on clusters, dynamic clusters,
and application server instances running on nodes. In the case of
dynamic clusters, regardless of the health policy that you are using,
the minimum number of dynamic cluster instances remains running.</p>
<ul class="ul" id="healthcondition__existing"><li class="li">When the <span class="ph uicontrol">age-based condition</span> breaches the
user-defined age value, the associated health actions are executed.
 This restart cleans out all cached and memory acquired data. If you
select age-based condition policy, you must define the age criteria.
The age-based condition is supported for all server types.</li>
<li class="li">The <span class="ph uicontrol">excessive request timeout condition</span> policy
tracks the memory that is used for request timeouts. When the percentage
of timeouts exceeds the breach of condition, the associated health actions
are executed. If you select the excessive request timeout condition,
you must set the memory used percentage threshold. The excessive request
timeout condition is supported for all server types.<div class="note restriction"><span class="restrictiontitle">Restriction:</span> The excessive request timeout condition does not
apply to Java Message Service
(JMS) and Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (IIOP) traffic.</div>
</li>
<li class="li">The <span class="ph uicontrol">excessive response time condition</span> policy
tracks the requests and the amount of time they take to complete.
When you select the excessive response time policy, you must define
the response time threshold. If in a specific time interval, the average
response time for the requests exceeds the threshold value, the health
policy is triggered. The excessive response time condition is supported
for all server types.</li>
<li class="li">The <span class="ph uicontrol">memory condition: excessive memory usage</span> policy
tracks the memory usage for a member. When the memory usage exceeds
a percentage of the heap size for a specified time, the health actions
are executed. If you select the excessive memory usage policy, you
must define the memory used and the time-over-memory threshold. The
excessive memory usage condition is supported only on application
servers on nodes that run WebSphere® Application
Server or WebSphere Application
Server Community Edition. You cannot define the excessive memory usage
condition for other middleware server types.</li>
<li class="li">The <span class="ph uicontrol">memory condition: memory leak</span> policy
tracks consistent downward trends in free memory that is available
to a server in the Java heap.
The detection level setting determines when these trends are detected.
 If you select the memory condition: memory leak policy, you must
define a detection level. The slower detection level setting requires
the most historical data. The normal and faster detection level settings
require the same amount of historical data, but the faster setting
allows analysis before the Java heap
expanded to its maximum configured size. This provides earlier detection capability, but is also more prone
to false positives. When this condition is breached, the health actions
are executed. The memory leak condition is not supported for other
middleware server types.</li>
<li class="li">The <span class="ph uicontrol"> storm drain condition</span> policy tracks
stuck requests. The health actions associated with this policy are
executed when the specified detection level is reached. Storm drain
detection relies on change point detection on a specific time series
data. The metrics that are used for detecting storm drain are the
response times and deployment workload manager weights that are observed
for the server. The storm drain condition applies only to dynamic
clusters and cells. If you select the storm drain condition policy,
you must select the detection level. <p class="p">To detect change points, the
health controller calculates a left mean and a right mean for a specific
point. For a point, the left mean consists of the mean value of <em class="ph i">N</em> samples
that arrive before this sample, and the right mean is the mean value
of <em class="ph i">N</em> samples, including the current point, that arrive later. The
difference of the left and the right mean values is stored and compared
with other differences in a set of values to <em class="ph i">N</em> to determine if
this difference is a local maxima. If this difference is the maximum
difference, then the point to which this difference corresponds, is
declared as a <em class="ph i">change point</em>. The two metrics that are used for
detecting storm drain are the response times and dynamic workload
manager weights that are observed for the server. </p>
The storm drain
condition is supported for all server types.<div class="note restriction"><span class="restrictiontitle">Restriction:</span> The
storm drain condition does not apply to JMS and IIOP traffic.</div>
</li>
<li class="li">The <span class="ph uicontrol">workload condition</span> policy executes
the associated health actions, when a specific user-defined number
of requests are serviced. If you select the workload policy, you must
define the total request criteria. The workload condition is supported
for all server types.</li>
<li class="li">The <span class="ph uicontrol">garbage collection percentage condition</span> policy
monitors a Java virtual machine
(JVM) or set of JVM’s to determine whether they are spending more
than the specified percentage of time in garbage collection over the
sampling time period. Since garbage collection increases processor
usage, this policy can inform you if poor performance is a result
of time spent in garbage collection.</li>

right mean, for calculating a difference of means and looking for
a local maxima. The samples are collected at intervals of 15 seconds.

The detection time is seven minutes and 30 seconds. However, because
there are more samples, the presence of samples with transient peaks
