               <a href="hc_detail_main_new.html">Creating a health policy: Define health policy general properties </a>
               <br/>Use this page to create health policies, which are used
to perform a variety of health-based assessments on clusters, dynamic
clusters, and application server instances running on nodes. </li>
            <li>
               <a href="hc_condition_detail_new.html">Creating a health policy: Define health condition properties</a>
               <br/>Use this page to define the specific behavior of the health
policy.</li>
            <li>
               <a href="hc_appservers_detail_new.html">Creating a health policy: Specify members to monitor</a>
               <br/>Use this page to assign membership properties to health
policies. </li>

               <a href="hc_action_collection.html">Custom actions collection</a>
               <br/>By default, you can define a health policy to execute any
of the predefined health actions, such as restart a server, when a
health policy is breached. Configure a custom action when you want
your environment to take an action other than these defaults. </li>
            <li>
               <a href="hc_custom_action.html">Custom actions settings</a>
               <br/>Specify details for your Java and
non-Java custom actions. </li>

               <a href="hc_condition_subex.html">Custom health condition subexpression builder</a>
               <br/>Use the custom health condition subexpression builder to
define a custom health condition for your health policy. Use the build
subexpression utility to build complex rule conditions from subexpressions
by using AND, OR, NOT and parenthetical grouping. The subexpression
builder validates the rule when you apply the changes, and alerts
you to mismatched parentheses and unsupported logic operators. </li>

detection and prevention. </li>
