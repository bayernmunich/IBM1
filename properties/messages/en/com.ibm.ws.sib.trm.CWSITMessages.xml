  <MsgText pgmKey="BOOTSTRAP_FAILED_CWSIT0007" varFormat="Java">
    BOOTSTRAP_FAILED_CWSIT0007=CWSIT0007W: It is not possible to contact the bootstrap server at {0} because of exception: {1}.
  </MsgText>
  <Explanation>
    The client cannot establish contact with the specified bootstrap server. This situation may be due to configuration problems, network problems or it may be that the required bootstrap server is currently unavailable. The client bootstrap process will continue with the next provider endpoint in the provider endpoints list.
  </Explanation>
  <UserResponse>
    Ensure that the network is working correctly and the required bootstrap server is available. The bootstrap server is specified by the Provider Endpoint property of the JMS connection factory. The endpoint address has the form host_name:port_number:chain_name (for example, localhost:7276:BootstrapBasicMessaging). The connection factory must specify the Provider Endpoint property if a non-default bootstrap server is being used.

    FAILED_AUTHENTICATION_CWSIT0089=CWSIT0089E: The user ID {0} failed authentication in bus {1}.
  </MsgText>
  <Explanation>
    The user ID used to create a client connection with a messaging engine failed to be authenticated by the remote messaging engine. The authentication failure was probably due to an incorrect user ID or password value.
  </Explanation>
  <UserResponse>
    Ensure that both the user ID and password values are correct.
