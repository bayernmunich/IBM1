    MISSING_JAR_FILE_CWSAF0037W=CWSAF0037W: Cannot find the JAR file {2} referenced by persistence unit {1} in persistence bundle {0}. Any entities in the JAR file {2} will not be enhanced.
  </MsgText>
  <Explanation>
    The JPA runtime environment scans any JAR files that are referenced in a persistence unit for entities. If it cannot find the JAR file, entities in the JAR file cannot be processed.
  </Explanation>
  <UserResponse>
    Check the structure of the persistence bundle, and check that the path to the JAR file is correct. The path defined in the JAR file element is relative to the persistence unit root. The persistence unit root is the parent directory of the META-INF/persistence.xml file that defines the persistence unit.
