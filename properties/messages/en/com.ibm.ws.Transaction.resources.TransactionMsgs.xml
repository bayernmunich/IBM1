    A transaction was previously marked rollbackOnly and has now been rolled back. This might be because of a transaction timeout, or an application decision to mark the transaction rollbackOnly.
  </Explanation>
  <UserResponse>
    No user action is required unless the rollback is undesirable and occurs because of a transaction timeout. If this is the case, investigate why the transaction takes longer to complete than the timeout period, and consider increasing the transaction timeout values for the server.

  <Explanation>
    The configured WS Transaction specification level default setting for the server may cause execution problems as all servers in the cluster are not at the same release of the Application Server.  All servers in the cluster need to support the same specification level since application requests or their recovery may be directed to any server.
