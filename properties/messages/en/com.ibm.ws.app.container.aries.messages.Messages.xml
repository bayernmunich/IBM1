<Message ID="CWSAI0038W" severity="W" prefix="yes">
  <MsgText pgmKey="INVALID_BLUEPRINT_REFERENCE_FILTER_ID" varFormat="Java">
    INVALID_BLUEPRINT_REFERENCE_FILTER_ID=CWSAI0038W: The blueprint bundle {0} contains a reference with ID {1}. The filter for this reference, {2}, is not valid, and so the runtime environment could not tell which shared bundles might be providing this service.
  </MsgText>
  <Explanation>
    To save system resources, the application server removes any shared OSGi bundles that are no longer used by any applications. To work out which bundles are being used, the runtime environment analyzes their service dependencies. If these cannot be determined, some shared bundles might be removed even though they are providing services that are in use. If these bundles are removed then some shared bundles might no longer function correctly.
  </Explanation>
  <UserResponse>
    Check the blueprint metadata for the named bundle and change the invalid filter so that it uses the correct syntax.
