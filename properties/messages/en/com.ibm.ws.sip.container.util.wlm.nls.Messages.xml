    MOC_UnkIbmNurs=ARFM4111I: Generational garbage collection is in use in an IBM JRE, but the nursery size limit is not known exactly; assuming {0} kilobytes.
  </MsgText>
  <Explanation>
    The autonomic memory overload protection controller is unable to determine the nursery size limit.
  </Explanation>
  <UserResponse>
    Either accept the assumed value, set the maxNonFullGcMemoryRelease custom property on the cluster, or use a non-generational collector.

  <Explanation>
    Autonomic memory overload protection will explicitly trigger a garbage collection when the memory usage is high, unless this function is disabled or a full garbage collection has been done too recently; when a generational garbage collection technique is in use, a full garbage collection is detected when the memory usage drops by more than a lesser collection can free.
  </Explanation>
  <UserResponse>
    If the chosen value is not good, set the maxNonFullGcMemoryRelease custom property on the cluster to indicate the critical amount of freed memory; a value of zero means every collection is deemed full, and a huge value means no collection (except those explicitly initiated by the protection function) will be deemed full.

  <Explanation>
    When collector values throughput over minimizing stop-the-world times, it improves the accuracy of the memory usage estimate. Otherwise, it only happens under urgent condition: the admission fraction of new dialogs is too small, so that it is hard for the collector itself to trigger a full GC to release the garbage in memory.
