# The following are messages used by SummaryMessage elements in the InstallPackageDescriptors for WAS ND.  
#
was.install.summary.all=A managed WebSphere Application Server node with default node name and a profile name of \"Custom01\" will be \
created on each of the remote targets and federated to the current deployment manager cell. After the operation completes successfully, \
use the deployment manager to create a server or a cluster of servers within the node. 

was.install.summary.400=Temporary place-holder Summary Message for installations on i5/OS.


was.installWithRespFile.summary.all=If the installation target is an existing installation, the centralized installation manager \
will attempt to stop all running servers on the target host before starting the install operation. The operation will be allowed \
to continue even if some running servers could not be stopped. However, the subsequent install may fail. If you do not want \
the running servers to be stopped by the centralized installation manager at this point, you should cancel this operation.    


was.uninstall.summary.all=The centralized installation manager \
will attempt to stop all running servers on the target host before starting the uninstall operation. The operation will be allowed \
to continue even if some running servers could not be stopped. However, the subsequent uninstall may fail. If you do not want \
the running servers to be stopped by the centralized installation manager at this point, you should cancel this operation.    


was.maintenance.update.warning.all=Before running the WebSphere Update Installer tool to install or uninstall maintenance on \
selected targets the centralized installation manager calls on the nodeagents on the target hosts to stop all the running \
server processes at the targets. If the nodeagents are not running on the target host, you must make sure all the server \
processes on the selected targets are stopped before proceeding. Upon successfully completing the maintenance update on the \
seleted target the centralized installation manager will automatically restart the nodeagent on the target host.
