<h1>WebSphere Provider</h1>
<p>Standard support for WebSphere v5.x, v6.x, and v7 is provided by
 a specially developed Exporter utility. This
utility is run on the target WebSphere installation and exports the
WebSphere configuration files into a portable format suitable for
processing by Visual Configuration Explorer. The main advantages of this
approach are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Windows has a path length limitiation of 255 characters.
	Because of this, copying over entire configuration repository file
	structures from non-Windows systems to the machine where Visual
	Configuration Explorer is installed can be very problematic. Using the
	installed runtime to export the WebSphere configuration avoids the
	pitfalls associated with collecting and using configurations stored on
	different file systems.</li>

	<li>Using the installed runtime to export the configuration means
	that you pick up all WebSphere configuration artifacts in their proper
	context. This means that you will be able to view configuration
	artifacts from any installed WebSphere stack product such as Business
	Integrator or Process Server.</li>

</ul>

<p>A standalone WebSphere Exporter utility has been provided within
the installation package for Visual Configuration Explorer. Using the
Visual Configuration Explorer <i>File-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Visual Configuration Explorer-&gt;Utilities</i> dialog, you must first deploy the <b><i>Visual
Configuration Explorer Headless Automation Runtime</i></b> package to a location of your choice, where it
may then be distributed to the target machines you wish to use.  Please refer to the <b><i>Automation</i></b> section under <b><i>Help-&gt;Visual Configuration Explorer-&gt;Tasks</i></b> for more information on deploying the Headless Automation Runtime.</p>
<p>A second method of exporting WebSphere configurations is by using the <i><b>IBM
Support Assistant v4 Collect Data</b></i> facility. Note that you must first download the <i><b>Visual
Configuration Explorer Topology Collecto</b>r</i> product add-on. Please refer to  IBM Support Assistant help for more information on deploying and using this option.</p>

<p><b>NOTE: The tools package should be updated on the target
WebSphere servers with each release of VCE. Make sure that all previous
versions of the tools package is first deleted prior to updating.
Failure to "clean install" the tools package with each release of VCE
will result in inconsistent behaviour.</b><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
<p>The export utility will produce a binary file that represents the
exported WebSphere configuration. This artifact can then be loaded
directly into Visual Configuration Explorer, and all of the  tool
functions will be available. The naming  for the
exported configuration can be controlled via command options.  <b>You
may rename exported files anything you wish as long at the
&quot;.configuration&quot; extension is maintained.</b>
</p><h2>Using the Headless Automation Runtime to produce the required configuration data</h2>
<p>The Headless Automation Runtime provides the ability to export WebSphere configurations to a form suitable for use by VCE. A specific ANT script is provided in the &quot;wasexporter&quot; subdirectory of the Headless Automation Runtime environment. To execute the script as a standalone task, proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
	<li>CD to the directory on the target server where the Headless Automation Runtime is installed.</li>
	<li>Execute the wasexport.xml script as follows:<br>
	<code>java -jar <i></i>startup.jar
	-buildfile <i>wasexporter/wasexport.xml
	[options]</i></code><br>where <i>[options] </i>are as follows:<br>
	<b>-Dwas.root</b>=&quot;install root of WebSphere installation&quot; [REQUIRED]<br>
	<b>-Dprofile.name</b>=&quot;profile name of desired configuration&quot; [OPTIONAL] Defaults to default profile of WebSphere install<br>
	<b>-Dwas.temp</b>=&quot;path for temporary files&quot; [OPTIONAL] Defaults to wasexporter/temp<br>
	<b>-Dwas.exp.dir</b>=&quot;directory to save exported configuration&quot; [OPTIONAL] Defaults to wasexporter/output<br>
	<b>-Dwas.exp.basename</b>=&quot;base name for the exported configuration&quot; [OPTIONAL] Defaults to either &quot;websphere&quot; or profile.name if specified</li>
	<li>The resulting exported configuration is then copied to a location accessible by VCE and can be added as a Provider to any active workspace. </li>
</ol>
<p>The WebSphere Configuration Exporter may also be called from another automation script as follows:</p>
<blockquote><pre>... <i><font color="maroon">set exporter options before calling</font></i>
&lt;target name=&quot;main&quot; depends=&quot;initProps&quot;&gt;
	<font color="maroon">&lt;!--Call the WebSphere Exporter--&gt;</font>
	&lt;ant antfile=&quot;wasexporter\wasexport.xml&quot; /&gt;
...</pre></blockquote>
<h2>Using the VCE Topology Collector IBM Support Assistant add-on
to automate the data collection</h2>
<p>The VCE Topology Collector for IBM Support Assistant v4 has built-in support for collecting the
required WebSphere configuration files. Simply run Data Collector on the desired
target system, and copy the resulting archive file into a directory
where Visual Configuration Explorer has access. Exploding the archive is
not required.</p>
<h2>Working with multiple WebSphere configurations simultaneously</h2>
<p>The WebSphere provider also supports opening multiple WebSphere
repositories simultaneously. This capability is very useful for things
like comparing 2 WebSphere cells, though it should be noted that the
compare function is not intended to provide meaningful compare between
cells of different versions.</p>
