<a href="ucli_ovrvw.html">Asynchronous messaging in WebSphere Application Server using
JMS</a>
<br />WebSphere Application
Server supports asynchronous messaging as a method of communication based
on the Java Message Service (JMS) programming interface. The
JMS interface provides a common way for Java programs (clients and Java Platform,
Enterprise Edition (Java EE) applications) to create, send,
receive, and read asynchronous requests as JMS messages.</li>
<li>
<a href="ucli_jmsprovider.html">Java Message Service providers for clients</a>
<br />Client applications can use messaging resources from three main
types of Java Message Service (JMS) providers in WebSphere Application Server:
The WebSphere Application Server default messaging provider (which uses service
integration as the provider), the WebSphere MQ messaging provider (which uses
your WebSphere MQ system as the provider) and third-party messaging providers
(which use another company's product as the provider).</li>
<li>
<a href="ucli_resourceadapt.html">Resource adapters for the client</a>
<br />A resource adapter is a system-level software driver that a Java application
uses to connect to an enterprise information system (EIS).  A resource adapter
plugs into an application client and provides connectivity between the EIS
and the enterprise application.</li>
