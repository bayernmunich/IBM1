<h2>WebSphere Application And Configuration Model Documentation</h2>

<p>This documentation provides a summary of the models used by the
WebSphere Application Server version 8.0, including J2EE Application
Models, IBM J2EE Bindings and Extensions Models, and Application
Server Configuration Models.</p>

<p>This documentation provides a title frame, and leftmost and
rightmost primary content frames.  The leftmost frame contains either
a list of all available model packages, or a list of all available
model classes, or a description of a single model package along with a
listing of the classes within that package.  The rightmost panel
contains either this documentation note, or contains the details for a
single model class.</p>

<p>Here a <b>model class</b> is a model class as defined through
Rational Rose.  Generally, a model class maps to an implementation
java class having the same name, but mapped also to an implementation
java package.</p>

<p>Model classes include both object types and data types.  Data types
include both basic data types, such as <code>Date</code> and
<code>Integer</code> as well as enumerated types.</p>

<p>The documentation for a model class shows a description of the
class, followed by listings of the attributes of the model class.
Both a summary listing of the attributes and a detail listing of the
attributes are provided.  The term <b>attribute</b> is used inclusive
of attributes containing data values, attributes containing references
to model objects, and attributes containing collections of model
objects.  Attributes and their types are expressed as:</p>

<p>&lt;attribute name&gt; : &lt;attribute type&gt; [@] [*] [+]

<p>The "@" symbol, if present, indicates that the attribute holds an
object of the specified type.</p>

<p>The "*" symbol, if present, indicates that the attribute contains a
collection of objects of the specified type, and allowing any number
of elements in the collection.</p>

<p>The "+" symbol, if present, indicates that the attribute contains a
collection of objects of the specified type, and requiring that there
be at least one element in the collection.</p>
