<!--
In this example, there are two deployment targets:
a cluster named "M13", and an unclustered server
named "alice" on the node named "lymph".
In the first DT, there are two service classes,
gold and silver.  The gold service class
gets 12 seats and 200 dialogs/second, divided equally among
the gateways sending load of the gold class
to M13.  For silver, 20 seats are evenly divided
among the HTTP gateways and another 12 seats are
divided explicitly and unequally among two SIP proxies;
no explicit dialog admission rate limit is given, which
means the dialog admissions are unlimited.
